# Welcome to the Stata Cookbook for Introduction to Data Science

## Introduction

During the course “Introduction to Data Science”, we will build our very own Stata Cookbook. This repository will hold a collection of useful Stata commands with notes on when and how to use them.

We encourage you to use the joint Stata Cookbook for this course to build your own personal cookbook. Our shared collection of commands will cover most of the commands you will be using throughout the course, but there are good reasons to build on that foundation: perhaps you want to augment our notes on how to use commands, so that they are more clear or fit your preferred use better. Perhaps you found a useful commands or tricks online and you want to include them in your personal cookbook. Most importantly, once “Introduction to Data Science” ends, you will continue to use Stata in other courses. Having your own personal cookbook allows you to keep adding new commands and notes.

## Get your copy

This repository always holds the most up-to-date version of our cookbook. There are two identical versions of the cookbook.
